# action-python-template

A template repository for GitHub Actions implemented in Python.

## Content

* `pytest` for tests: `make test`
* `ruff` for linting/formatting: `make lint` (replaces both `black` and `isort`)
* `.github` with actions ready to be used
    * ...
* `action.yml` and `entrypoint.py` to serve as placeholders with a valid dummy action
* Template README.md below

## New project checklist

* [ ] Replace `action.yml` with your action details
* [ ] Replace `entrypoint.py` with your code
* [ ] Replace `LICENSE` if MIT does not apply
* [ ] Search the project for `# TODO` to find the (minimum list of) places that need to be changed

It also adds a joke to output `joke` to brighten your day.
